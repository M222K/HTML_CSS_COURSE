    <h1>About meta tags</h1>
    <p> viewport is the area of the window in which web content can be seen.
        Some mobile devices and other narrow screens render pages in a virtual window or viewport, which is usually
        wider than the screen, and then shrink the rendered result down so it can all be seen at once.
        <br>
        The basic attributes of the "viewport"
    <ul>
        <li><mark>width</mark>:Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like
            width=600 or to the special value device-width, which is 100vw, or 100% of the viewport width.</li>
        <li><mark>height</mark>Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like
            height=400 or to the special value device-height,.</li>
